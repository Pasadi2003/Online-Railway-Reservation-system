It is a major transport service provider and is the only rail transport organization in the country. SLR transports both passenger and freight. At its inception, railway was carrying more freight than passenger. But today, it is passenger oriented. SLR’s market share for passenger transport is about 6.0 % and about 0.7 % for goods transport.In Sri Lanka, the service provided by SLR in carrying the daily commuters to their workplaces, is inevitable. Sri Lanka Railway operates approximately 396 trains which include 67 Long-Distance and 16 Intercity trains and carries about 3.72 Million passengers daily.</span></p> -->
